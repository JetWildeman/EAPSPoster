        <header><h3>SSA's background of high birth rates</h3></header>

    <p>The birth rates in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries are among the highest in the world. At the same time, there infrastructure is among the poorest in the world, and as such many communities in SSA are hard to reach. Individuals living in these remote communities hardly receive information and ideas regarding fertility behavior from outside their community.
	<br><br>The received information and ideas about fertility are a key element in determining a person's future fertility behavior following diffusion theories. As such, diffusion theories predict that if current fertility rates are high, they are likely to remain high in SSA due to the poor quality of their infrastructure.</p>

    <header><h3>The rise of social media</h3></header>
    <p>One type of infrastructure, the digital infrastructure, showed a rapid expansion in most recent years. Over 90% of the Africans had access to a mobile phone and almost 30% was connected to the internet in 2020. The digital infrastructure enabled the use of social media, which is characterized by digital interactivity between its users. 
	<br><br>As the digital infrastructure transcends the community borders easily, social media has the potential to expose individuals to less community-specific and to more globalized fertility behaviors. As such, an important question has arisen: “To what extent is social media related to fertility rates in subnational regions in SSA? </p>

    <header><h3>Research Questions & Hypotheses</h3></header>
    <p>To what extent is social media coverage associated with birth rates in subnational regions in SSA? 
	<br><br> H1: A higher subnational Facebook coverage relates with lower subnational crude birth rates.
	<br><br>To what extent is social media coverage of women versus men associated with birth rates?
	<br><br> H2: When women have better access to social media in comparison to men, we expect lower subnational birth rates.

    <header><h3>Methods & data</h3></header>
    <p>To create subnational social media indicators, we used Facebook’s advertisement platform. Facebook allows their users to search the number of active Facebook users in last month disaggregated by various geographic and demographic characteristics (detailed information 
	can <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis">here</a> be found). We created active users estimates for individuals aged 15-39 for 311 subnational regions in 29 SSA countries.
	<br>The Facebook data was combined with data from the <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/">DHS</a> and <a href="https://mics.unicef.org/">MICS</a> surveys to create subnational crude birth rates, and with data from the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/home">World Bank</a>
	and the <a href="https://www.afrobarometer.org/">Afrobarometer</a> to create the independent variables.
	<br><br> Method: multilevel regression models and OLS regression models with Crude Birth Rates as dependent variable are applied.

    <header><h3>Regression results</h3></header>

	<p> The results revealed that higher social media coverage and smaller gender gaps in social media coverage are significantly associated with lower birth rates.

    <header><h3>Discussion</h3></header>
    <p> A possible explanation in line with diffusion theories is that social media enable their users to form (online) communities in which information and ideas can be spread irrespective of an individual's place of living. But, we cannot exclude the alternative interpretation that individuals who had different norms and values were more likely to be exposed to social media.
	<br><br>Future thoughts and research are required to disentagle the mechanisms that explain the association between fertility levels and social media. Understanding what is going on is urgent because social media is becoming more and more prevalent en this study showed potential consequences in terms of birth rates, and thus also potentially population growth.
